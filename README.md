# Better Biome Provider for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A mod that implements caching for the climate noise used in biome provision, generation, and more, theoretically improving performance. A backport of the implementation used for [Modern Beta Fabric](https://github.com/b3spectacled/modern-beta-fabric). 

Just a small thing to try out Cursed Legacy for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

This mod requires [Minecraft Cursed Legacy](https://minecraft-cursed-legacy.github.io/) and [Cursed Legacy API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cursed-legacy-api).
